
# Scalable E-commerce System

A scalable and high-performance e-commerce application built with Node.js, Express.js, and other modern technologies. This project is designed to handle a large number of concurrent users and includes features such as real-time updates, product management, shopping cart functionality, payment processing, and more.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**
  - JWT-based authentication.
  - Role-based access control (Admin, Customer, Guest).
  
- **Product Catalog & Search**
  - Scalable product catalog with pagination.
  - Full-text search using Elasticsearch.
  - Advanced filtering (price range, ratings, etc.).
  
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout**
  - Cart management (Add, Remove, Update items).
  - Order management and payment integration with Stripe/PayPal.
  - Order status tracking.
  
- **Real-Time Features**
  - Real-time notifications (order updates, promotions) using WebSockets/Socket.io.
  
- **Scalability & Performance**
  - Horizontal scaling with load balancing (Nginx/HAProxy).
  - Caching with Redis for frequently accessed data.
  - Optimized database with sharding and replication (MongoDB/PostgreSQL).
  - Microservices architecture with Docker and Kubernetes.
  
- **Inventory Management**
  - Real-time stock updates and alerts.
  - Redis for managing inventory updates across multiple instances.

- **API Rate Limiting & Security**
  - Rate limiting with Redis to prevent abuse.
  - Secure payment integration (Stripe/PayPal).
  
- **Monitoring & Logging**
  - Application monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
  - Structured logging with Winston.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Docker (for microservices)
- Redis (for caching and inventory management)
- Elasticsearch (for search functionality)
- PostgreSQL (optional, for relational data)
- Kubernetes (for container orchestration)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scalable-ecommerce-system.git
   cd scalable-ecommerce-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set up the necessary environment variables like database connection strings, JWT secrets, and payment gateway API keys.

   Example:

   ```
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. For microservices setup with Docker:

   - Build and start Docker containers:

     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

   - Use Kubernetes for container orchestration if needed.

## Scalability Testing

- Use **Artillery** or **JMeter** to simulate up to 1 million concurrent users and test the performance of the system under heavy load.
- Monitor the system's performance using **Prometheus** and **Grafana** dashboards.

To test scalability:

1. Run load tests with **Artillery**:

   ```bash
   artillery run load-test-config.yml
   ```

2. Monitor metrics and identify bottlenecks with **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.
