# 🔐 Robust Auth Service

This is a **production-grade, scalable authentication service** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, **JWT**, **Redis**, and **Docker**. It is designed to be secure, highly available, and capable of handling high traffic. The service is structured as a microservice that follows modern security and architectural best practices.

## 🚀 Features

- **JWT Access & Refresh Token Strategy** for stateless authentication.
- **Secure Password Hashing** with bcrypt (12+ salt rounds).
- **Rate Limiting** using Redis to prevent brute-force and DDoS attacks.
- **Token Blacklisting** with Redis for logging out users and invalidating refresh tokens.
- **Email Verification** with token-based activation links.
- **Password Reset** with OTP or reset token-based links.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for permission management.
- **Input Validation** using Joi or Zod to ensure data correctness.
- **XSS Protection** to safeguard against malicious scripts.
- **CSRF Protection** for cookie-based authentication flows.
- **CORS** configuration for trusted domains.
- **Health Check Endpoint** for readiness/liveness probes.
- **Structured Logging** using Winston or Pino for easy debugging.
- **Metrics Setup** with Prometheus or OpenTelemetry for observability.

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Password Security
- **bcrypt** is used for hashing passwords with **12+ salt rounds** for optimal security.
- Passwords are never stored in plaintext in the database.

### Token Security
- **JWT** is used for access tokens with **short expiry times** and **refresh tokens** for session persistence.
- **Token Blacklisting** via Redis to handle logout and token invalidation, ensuring old refresh tokens cannot be reused.
- **JWT Expiry** and **signature verification** are implemented with proper secure algorithms (RS256 or HS256).

### Rate Limiting
- Protects endpoints from **brute-force** attacks and **DDoS** using **express-rate-limit** with Redis as the store for counting requests per IP.

### Input Validation
- **Joi** or **Zod** are used to validate all inputs (e.g., user registration data, login credentials) to ensure correct data types and prevent malicious input.

### XSS & CSRF Protection
- XSS protection is implemented to prevent malicious JavaScript injections in user inputs and responses.
- CSRF protection is available for **cookie-based authentication** (if applicable).

### CORS Configuration
- **CORS** is configured to allow only trusted domains to access the API.

## 🧠 Advanced Auth Flow

1. **Access Token + Refresh Token**: 
    - Access tokens are short-lived and used for authentication, while refresh tokens are used to issue new access tokens without re-authenticating.
2. **Token Blacklisting**: 
    - Blacklist refresh tokens using Redis to invalidate them after logout or password change.
3. **Email Verification**: 
    - Sends an email verification link with a token to activate user accounts after registration.
4. **Password Reset**: 
    - Allows password resets via an OTP or token sent to the user's email.
5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
    - Implement user roles (e.g., Admin, User) to control access to different parts of the application.
